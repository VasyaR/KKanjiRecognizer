This package is created for recognizing kanji from images. 
The model that is used for recognizing is Preact-Resnet-18.
Model can destinguish 300 classes with most sample from KKanji https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist.
The model was trained on 64x64 grayscale images with white kanji on black backgound.
You are able to use function recognize_kanji() with black_background=False in case you have the opposite situation.
Also, in case you want to experiment more, you can change model_confidence from 0 to 1, but the initial value
is set with value, that showed best performance during our experiments.
